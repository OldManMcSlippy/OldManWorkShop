The negative inner voices feed and fuel off my Neuroticism.
Introduce new positive voices?
Increasing Conscientiousness and decreasing Neuroticism would help. Maybe increasing Openness would help.
Stefan Molyneux's voice feeds off of my anxiety an fear. Might need to find better ways of coping with anxiety. 
He also feeds off of my helpless and hopeless moments. Also my insecurity.
I hate conflict and seek to avoid it at all times. Stefan represents a big conflict of morals and ideas, so I fear him.
Action Plan:
Habit/System: Trying to get better inner voices in my head and getting the demonic voices out.
What will this habit be composed of?
Writing out the voices of the angelic voices and trying to absorb them.
Meditating on the angelic spirits of the mind.
Using advice given by the angelic spirits.
Defining and categorizing the angelic spirits.
Understanding the demons and what made them come to be.
