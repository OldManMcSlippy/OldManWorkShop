I am miserable most of the time.
I am lonely most of the time.
I have a hard time going to sleep on time.
I have a hard time coping with difficulties
I am addicted a lot of the time to something since I can't find solutions to my problems.
I am addicted to things that aren't really productive.
I am not funny.
I am not socialble
I am feeling sad most of the time.
I am anxious and scared a lot.
I have a hard time being in the present.
