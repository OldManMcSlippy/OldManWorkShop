The negative inner voices feed and fuel off my Neuroticism.
Introduce new positive voices?
Increasing Conscientiousness and decreasing Neuroticism would help. Maybe increasing Openness would help.
Stefan Molyneux's voice feeds off of my anxiety an fear. Might need to find better ways of coping with anxiety. 
He also feeds off of my helpless and hopeless moments. Also my insecurity.
I hate conflict and seek to avoid it at all times. Stefan represents a big conflict of morals and ideas, so I fear him.
