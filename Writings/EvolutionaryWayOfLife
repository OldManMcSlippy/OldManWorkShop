What I would desire of a Pagan way of Life is a strict Evolutionary way of living. 
Which means living with strong clans, tribes, and nations.
I get the idea's name from the Evolutionary theory of government.
This way of life has its trade-offs ( like pretty much everything)
Downsides, Weaknesses, Shortcomings, Failings, etc.:
Conformity to the collective is a must in most cases, sense everyone being on the same page is necessary for cohesion and self-governence.
Adoption from outside the tribe/nation maybe necessary since endogamy in tribes and nations(NOT IN CLANS)might result in a stale gene-pool.
Upsides, Strengths, Successes, etc.:
Clans and tribes are able to govern themselves and tend to be self-sufficent to an extant.
Genealogical bonds and shared ancestry increase cohesion and a collective identity.
Clans tend to care for the weak, sick, young, elderly, and unfortunate more which eliminates the need for social programs from a State.
