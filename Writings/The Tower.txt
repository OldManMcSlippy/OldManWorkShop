There was a tower overlooking the trade route. 
This tower was around 40 feet tall. 
It was built with a mixture of stone and wood, the latter making up most of the top and the former making up most of the bottom. 
The tower was only accessible by climbing up a hill that was at a 45* angle and had no trees upon its faces. 
At the tallest point of the tower was a place where a man could fire a bow that could travel far and hit a mark with deadliness.
