The interior of OldMan's mind shall be called the Inner Sanctum
Called so because it is the most private place where OldMan can do anything pretty much.
OldMan's fantasy manor:
On a hill exists a building complex which is surrounded by a wall and the wall is surrounded by farmland.
The complex has a workshop, temple, and manor house. Inside the manor house is the recreation wing and living wing.
OldMan is the only person in the mansion at most times but he does have imaginary friends:
Marcus Aurelius is a friend who helps him with sage wisdom and practical advice.
Mason Hart helps Marcus.
Yogi is there as a compassionate voice to help OldMan with his troubles.
There are also many local spirits and minor gods around the Mansion who help OldMan through his troubles.
OldMan gives these spirits/gods the right to be at peace in the mansion and tries to help when he feels well.
